A survivor of General Grievous' massacre of the Nightsisters during the Clone Wars, Merrin encountered the Jedi Master Taron Malicos after he crash-landed on Dathomir following the execution of Order 66 in 19 BBY, which called for the extermination of all Jedi. Malicos fell to the dark side of the Force, and wishing to learn the Nightsister's magick, he manipulated Merrin through lies that the Jedi were responsible for her losses and false promises to help her avenge her fallen friends, sisters, and mothers.",
